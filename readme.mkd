# Facezoomer
*I am so sorry for making this*

Basically, put a photo with faces in the `pictures` folder, run the script, wait a second or two, get the cropped faces out of the folder. It sometimes fails (As can be seen in the test photos)

Copyright of the supplied images goes to the copyright holders.

I pulled this script togeather from a stack overflow answer, and some other stuff, there is almost no original code in here.

Please be nice with this.
